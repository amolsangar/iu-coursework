** Course Information and Objectives
  In this class we will develop a thorough understanding of foundation principles,
  architectures, and techniques employed in computer networks. A network is
  viewed as a hierarchy of layers, or abstract machines. Each layer uses
  services offered by lower layers to in turn provide enhanced service to the
  next higher layer. These layers form a protocol suite.  This course focuses
  on protocols and mechanisms used in the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite,
  including the design and operation of both wide-area and local-area
  networks. In the homework and lab components of this course, we will implement 
  simplified versions of the TCP/IP protocols using application-level network programming.
 
  Specific topics include: 
   - introduction (network architectures, protocol layering, TCP/IP and OSI Reference Models)
   - application layer (Web and http, email, file transfer, DNS)
   - transport layer (TCP, UDP, connection management, end-to-end reliable data transfer, sliding window protocols,
                      quality of service, flow control, congestion control, socket programming)
   - network layer (link-state vs. distance-vector routing, IPv4, IPv6, internetworking)
   - local area and wireless networks (Ethernet, switches, 802.11, CDMA)
   - data link layer (framing, error control, CRC checksums,)
   - physical layer (analog vs digital transmission, the telephone system, packet vs circuit switching, multiplexing).
